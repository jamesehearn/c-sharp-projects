C# development I've done

Audio Browser is a project I've just started working on. Eventually, it will expand to include:

- a SQL search function for finding audio files inside of a database
- a visualization component to show what the waveform looks like

Expanded abilities would include the ability to select an audio sample, then import the smaple into your DAW of choice for use in the DAW.
